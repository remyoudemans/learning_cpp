# Learning CPP

## Things I want to explore
- how dependencies really work? seems bonkers that there's no standard dependency manager
- multi-threading
- dynamic memory management
- graphics
- imports/header files/code reuse

## Projects I want to do
- practice a bunch of algorithms
- practice a bunch of data structures
- try making some sort of gui
- make a web server
